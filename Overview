A comprehensive project to analyze spectral reflectance data of corn samples, reduce feature dimensionality, and predict DON (Deoxynivalenol) concentration using machine learning models.

Project Overview
This repository implements:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values, normalization, and visualizations (e.g., line plots, heatmaps).
2. Dimensionality Reduction
   - Utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE to reduce feature dimensions and visualize patterns.
3. Model Training
   - Training a Deep Learning model (Neural Network) to predict DON concentrations.
   - Splitting dataset into training and testing sets and optimizing hyperparameters.
4.Model Evaluation
   - Using regression metrics: MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².
   - Visualizing results with scatter plots and residual plots.
