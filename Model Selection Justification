Neural Network (Deep Learning):

Choice: A simple feedforward neural network with ReLU activation and dropout regularization.

Rationale: Neural networks handle high-dimensional data effectively and can capture non-linear relationships in spectral data. Dropout prevents overfitting, and ReLU ensures efficient training with non-saturating gradients.

Trade-off: Neural networks require more computational resources compared to traditional regression models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees). Performance heavily depends on hyperparameter tuning, which can be time-intensive.
