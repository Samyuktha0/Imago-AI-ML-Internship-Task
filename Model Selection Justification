Neural Network (Deep Learning):

Choice: A simple feedforward neural network with ReLU activation and dropout regularization.

Rationale: Neural networks handle high-dimensional data effectively and can capture non-linear relationships in spectral data. Dropout prevents overfitting, and ReLU ensures efficient training with non-saturating gradients.

Trade-off: Neural networks require more computational resources compared to traditional regression models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees). Performance heavily depends on hyperparameter tuning, which can be time-intensive.


Challenges Encountered:
Hyperparameter tuning was critical for achieving competitive performance metrics (e.g., adjusting the number of neurons, batch size, learning rate).

Smaller dataset size could cause overfitting despite dropout and early stopping mechanisms.
